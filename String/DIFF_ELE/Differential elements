Dicritisation of the equasion 


For the string the conditions are :
# Boundary conditions:
        One end of the string (at position 0) is driven by a sinusoidal pulse.

        The other end (at the last position) is fixed (displacement is always zero).

# Numerical Calculation:

    The wave equation is discretized in space and time.
    For each time step, the function updates the displacement of every point on the string based on the previous two time steps and the neighboring points.
# The Mathematical equation behind the string 
Fundamental frequency: f1=v2/L ​, where vv is the wave speed and LL is the string length.
Harmonic frequencies: Higher harmonics are multiples of the fundamental, fn=n⋅f1fn​=n⋅f1​.
To find the resonance frequency: You need to know the wave speed (based on the string's tension and mass per unit length) and the length of the string.

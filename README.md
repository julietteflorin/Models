**"Comparative Analysis of Finite Difference and Finite Element Method for Audio Waveform Simulation"**  
by Juliette Florin (EURECOM, Department of Digital Security)


## ðŸ“„ Overview research

The report investigates and compares the performance of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM) in simulating audio waveforms produced by physical objects such as guitar strings and bells. Key topics include:

- Wave propagation and resonance modeling  
- Frequency-domain error analysis using FFT  
- Impact of time discretization on numerical accuracy  
- Visualization and interpretation of vibrational modes
